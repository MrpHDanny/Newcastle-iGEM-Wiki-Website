                                <p>Today was the first day of Newcastle iGEM 2019! We started the day right with a cup
                                    of tea
                                    and some lovely pastries. This was followed by a great introductory talk from
                                    Professor
                                    Frank Sargent who inducted us into iGEM and introduced the wide spanning capacity of
                                    SynBio.
                                    Jasmine Bird, Bradley Brown, and Alba Iglesias then gave the team a run through of
                                    the
                                    specifics of iGEM and important things to keep an eye on... particularly the wiki!
                                    We then
                                    spent the afternoon brainstorming and having a research of some winning projects
                                    from iGEMs
                                    past to prepare for a mini presentation tomorrow.</p>

                            <div class="carousel-item">
                                <p>For day 2 of our iGEM bootcamp Jasmine Bird introduced us to the importance of
                                    measurement
                                    within a project to strengthen our results; sadly, we have ran out of snacks
                                    (sponsorships
                                    welcome!). We were then joined by Dr Colette Whitfield who gave us inspiration of
                                    how
                                    cell-free systems and hydrogels could be incorporated into our project. Dr Maria del
                                    Carmen
                                    Montero-Calasanz also dropped by to give a brief talk about her research in
                                    plant-microbe
                                    interactions and helped us expand on any ideas that may start to be forming in the
                                    back of
                                    our minds. Today we also gave our mini presentations on different projects that we
                                    liked -
                                    taking about 90 minutes to switch between users after each one.</p>

                                <p>The weather today was gloomy, typical Newcastle! We started the day off with an
                                    introductory
                                    talk from Alex Laverick and Dr Tom Howard about lab automation on how to carry out
                                    experiments more efficiently. Dr Harold Fellermann followed on with a talk on
                                    mathematical
                                    modelling and biodesign. We then had a gene construct design task set by Dr Jem
                                    Stach to
                                    test the presence of nitroxoline using GFP and to be compatible for BioBrick, which
                                    we only
                                    had two hours to complete! We initially added the wrong BioBrick prefix as there was
                                    no
                                    XbaI, which Dr Stach pointed out when we presented our results – we fixed this and
                                    added the
                                    correct prefix. We were successful although it was suggested we could change the
                                    restriction
                                    sites to be adapted to Type IIs and to use RFP for screening.</p>

                                    barking next
                                    door…turns out there were therapy dogs visiting!

                            <div class="carousel-item">
                                <p>Day 4! Busy day today. We kicked off the day with a workshop with Professor Angharad
                                    Gatehouse discussing bio-economy and current ideas of an iGEM project this summer.
                                    Dr Maxim
                                    Kapralov then gave us a talk regarding climate change, increased CO2 levels and the
                                    potential of CO2 sequestration . After this we attended a seminar delivered by Dr
                                    Eileen Yu
                                    from the school of Engineering about bioelectrical chemical systems with academics
                                    from the
                                    school of Natural and Environmental Sciences. Dr Vas Andriotis presented us with his
                                    ideas
                                    about using metabolic pathways to detect oncoming drought in crops. Some of our team
                                    members
                                    were interested in using biofuels as alternatives to fossil fuels. Unfortunately,
                                    there were
                                    no talks scheduled in for the bootcamp about this topic. So, we asked Dr Ethan Hack
                                    to give
                                    a talk about using algae to make biofuels, which he graciously gave. It’s fair to
                                    say we
                                    have been worked today and developed some new ideas! Time for a nap…</p>

                                <p>The day started off with a talk from Dr Angel Goni-Monreno on behalf of Newcastle
                                    University's School of Computing. The concepts of cellular computing were
                                    introduced, with
                                    specific focus on engineering genetic circuits and how to approach standardisation
                                    within
                                    SynBio. Alba Iglesias Vilches then followed on with a preparation talk for the
                                    jamboree and
                                    how to make science accessible for all - highlighting the importance for diversity
                                    and
                                    inclusion within iGEM as a whole. The team then discussed our current ideas to
                                    tackle
                                    inclusion and accessibility. For example, using a single dyslexic-friendly font
                                    throughout
                                    the wiki. The morning was then concluded with a talk from Dr Martyn Dade-Robertson,
                                    a reader
                                    in Architectual Design Computation, who explored SynBio with an Architect’s approach
                                    to the
                                    design and manipulation of construction materials.

                                    By noon the team were all rather tired and lacklustre. Unfortunately, the absence of
                                    a
                                    couple of team members only contributed to the mutual deflated feeling. To cheer
                                    ourselves
                                    up, but also as a pre-presentation treat, we headed to a local carvery for lunch!!

                                <p>After a brief Q&A the team received ample feedback for all of our proposed ideas.
                                    Some
                                    suggestions included changing our soil biosensor to a vector-disease detection
                                    system, as
                                    well as the modification of algae to produce specific high value product such as
                                    saffron. In
                                    addition, we were also asked to consider audience sensitivity with regards to
                                    drug-use and
                                    reasons behind purity detection. It was suggested that even changing it to the
                                    purity
                                    detection of alternatively sourced medical pharmaceuticals may be more suitable. Our
                                    audience was asked to vote for their three preferred ideas on an online anonymous
                                    poll. The
                                    top three choices are highlighted in bold on the long-list above.

                                <p>The presentations and subsequent feedback was not nearly as daunting as originally
                                    thought.
                                    Though the team now has much to consider before we select our short-list of project

                                <p> Second week of bootcamp! Today we had a talk from Dr Dana Ofiteru from the School of
                                    Engineering to tell us about mathematical modelling of microbial communities and she
                                    was
                                    very helpful in explaining the different types of models and gave examples for each.
                                    Also as a team, we decided on our three choices...</p>

                                <p>

                                    approaches.
                                    We used the iGEM 2018 Hamburg project as our modelling example. We then allocated
                                    our
                                    chosen projects between us to research and put together a project plan for each idea
                                    for

                                <p>Today we continued our work on researching our 3 ideas. We primarily directed our
                                    focus on the Parkinson's biosensor as Connor and Karen made a few discoveries which
                                    meant we had to reconsider our approach. Just before lunch we had a quick Skype with
                                    the University of Waterloo over in Canada to learn about their project and discuss
                                    potential collaborations (thank you to them for getting up at 7am!) From this point,
                                    we spent the rest of the day exploring additional targets for our biosensor and
                                    discussing how Connor wasn't aware about the different breeds of cat.</p>

                                    talk from Ken Taylor and Simon Woods, in this we found out certain aspects of our
                                    projects may be ethically questionable, and we would need to think a lot about how
                                    to tackle sensitive topics of discussion if we take our Parkinson's biosensor
                                    project forward. We will also need to consider the legal aspect of any of our

                                    committee. We had a presentation from Dr. Alice Banks regarding the use of computer
                                    modelling to optimize a cell free system. We also had a talk from Adnan Yaramis, a

                                    and how they affect plant growth. The rest of the day we spent finalising our 3
                                    final ideas for our final short list presentation. We will be presenting these ideas
                                    to university researchers, lectures and members of the ethics committee. Hopefully
                                    we will decide what project we conduct for the summer. Wish us luck!</p>

                                    instructors, plus any academics who had provided talks throughout the bootcamp. The
                                    presentations were followed by another Q&A feedback session and it became apparent
                                    that although engineering carbonic anhydrase to improve RuBisCo efficiency would be
                                    super cool and exciting, it was too complex and lengthy - not suitable for a summer
                                    iGEM project. After much debate and of course a cheeky Nando's, the team weighed up
                                    the pro's and con's for both our vector pathogen repellent (modified re-root
                                    aversion) and our Parkinson's Disease biosensor. We carried out an anonymous poll
                                    and it was a near even split. However, after some discussion regarding both the
                                    project plan and general direction, the entire team was in agreement. </p>

                                <p>Our PD biosensor was inspired by Joy Milne a "super smeller" with the unique ability
                                    to "smell" PD on her late husband. Joy described her husband Les as smelling “musky”
                                    up-to 10 years prior to his PD diagnosis. After further research, we discovered that
                                    the odour Joy was detecting was actually Malassezia fungal growth associated with
                                    seborrheic dermatitis, a non-motor symptom of PD due to immune deficiency. We are
                                    now attempting to develop a triplet biomarker system, each biomarker will run
                                    independently, and only a collective positive result for all three tests will result
                                    in a confirmed need for a diagnosis of PD.</p>

                    <p>This week we finalised our wiki design plans as well as assembling the sequences of our gene
                        constructs. When finalising wiki design plans we focused heavily on balancing the appearance

                        this was a primary concern. Taking inspiration from Parkinson's UK colour schemes we opted for a
                        scheme including a variety of blues with a splash of grey. Blue is colourblind friendly while
                        also reducing contrast enough to minimise impact on those with dyslexia. Below you'll see a
                        behind the scenes picture of how we chose more final versions of the colours we wanted to use.
                        Thankfully, Karen decided to wear this blouse today!!</p>
